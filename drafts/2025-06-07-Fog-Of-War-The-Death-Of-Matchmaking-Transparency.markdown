TL;DR : Over the last few years game developers have been removing the ability for gamers to research matchmaking manipulation by removing systems used to be commonplace, like viewing others battlelogs, publicly available APIs, and user data requests that are missing important information. 

Without such systems in place it is impossible for gamers to have *any* idea of what is truly going on behind the scenes, and developers will have free reign to manipulate matchmaking and abuse players.

This is an *extremely* slippery slope.

### Systems In Place To Limit Research

(could be its own short thing, and then reference it here - with some bullets and a link?)

**Inability to view others logs.**
- Being able to click through to someone elses profile and view the ranks, and win rates, of the players *they* are playing against. 

Currently you can view win rates, ranks, and stats for players that are in the same lobby as you, but thats it. If you want to research the ranks and win rates that other players are coming up against you are blocked.

This used to be commonplace, and over the last 3/4 years is being erroded out of games so that developers can hide the extent of matchmaking manipulation that they are implementing. Literally just a few years ago when this was commonplace you were able to go through profiles of players and compare ranks, stats, and win rates, of *their* lobbies to see if players were playing in easier or harder games than yourself. Long story short it would let us see how extreme SBMM was, and to judge how fair the matchmaking was for a given rank. This is now completely impossible. 

I understand giving people the option to hide their stats and profile from others by making it private, but even publicly available profiles are...
Some games don't even provide battlelogs for the player, there are no battlelogs at all. I'll provide evidence in future for a company doing just this, and why it is a *huge* red flag...

**No API**
- blah blah blah, essentially same as above but on an even larger scale.

Again used to be commonplace...

**Incomplete (Or In Netease's Case, Refusal To Provide) User Data**
- Blah blah blah

**Lying Support/Developers**
- Comapnies telling their staff to literally lie about blah blah blah

This is another big one that I'll go over in future but yes, they literally are doing this...
