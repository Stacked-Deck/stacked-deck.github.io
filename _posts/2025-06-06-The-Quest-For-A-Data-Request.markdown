TL;DR : Netease are essentially refusing to send me my gameplay data. 

&nbsp;


### What Happened?

As part of researching matchmaking manipulation, I decided to contact Netease Support to get my match data, so that I could collate everything and bring forward evidence blah...

It was impossible to do so constantly given the run around etc

&nbsp;


### The Evidence

(images - explain each one with short text)

&nbsp;


### Isn't That Illegal?

I think so, and at the very least it *should* be. I live in the UK where we basically have the same laws as the EU when it comes to user data (something called GDPR).

Even though Netease is based in China, and so *could* (and clearly *want to*) refuse to hand over my data, since they have offices in the UK and Europe (XYZ to be exact) they should legally be on the hook to provide me with my user data once I request it.

This is pretty robust too. The second I make a data request the company in question has 30 days to comply and send the data, if they don't they are breaching GDPR and the UK's ICO (Information Commisioners Office) has the power to fine (confirm specifics), etc, etc.

Companies aren't able to make excuses to delay this, literally the second I make a request in any form (that includes a support ticket), they *must* comply. They may request that I prove my identity first, but if they don't then they must send the data in 30 days. Even if it takes them 2 weeks to ask me to prove my identity, the clock has already started and they have 16 days remaining to complete the data request. (confirm this but pretty sure its correct tbf)

Compare this to Call of Duty. Activision didn't make the game in the UK or Europe, but since they have offices...

&nbsp;


### So... The Data? What's Going On?

As things stand... I should have pressed or contact the ICO but had more pressing things to do, but have decided to come back to this blah

 I can't wait to see what actual data I get back, and what is not included etc, that is of course if I get any data at all.

&nbsp;


### Systems In Place To Limit Research

This is just *another* system thats being put in place to...

(just add some bullets and a link to the full article)

### Takeaways

This should be a warning... 

I know ActiBlizz aren't a "good company" but it is a stark contrast when dealing with a (western) company thats bound by law... And tbf they are the only company I have seen provide hidden MMR data in user data requests. Is there *seriously* any gamer out there that thinks that games companies should be allowed to hide this from us, as if it's *not* user data.

This is currently a grey area and hasn't be legally contested (which is something I'm hoping to do in the near future)...

I know China is a modern day boogie man but this is a *real* problem, and something that gamers should be aware of, and worried about more and more in future, especially as Chinese companies like Tencent gobble up developers left right and center...

The whole MMR data from CoD, but have requested MMR data from other companies and they refuse to hand it over. This is a whole other can of worms and so it's a topic to save for another time but it *is* something we need to start discussing more - specifically the levels of obfuscation games companies are allowed to have, especially when it comes to "competitive" multiplayer games. This wouldn't have been a necessity XX years ago, but we're well deep into the era of Skill Based Matchmaking, Engagement Optimised Matchmaking, and now unfortunately Rigged & Heavily Manipulated Matchmaking to the point that it is a necessity (that...)
