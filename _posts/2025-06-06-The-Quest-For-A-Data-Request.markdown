TL;DR : Netease are illegally refusing to send me my gameplay data. When I get this data I'll be able to prove extreme levels of matchmaking manipulation from Marvel Rivals Season 0. The fact they're refusing to send the data should be a warning sign for gamers about the state the industry is taking. Trust me Netease is up to some seriously fucked up shit, and they're trying *really* hard to keep it covered up.

&nbsp;


### Intro

I've been doing research into Marvel Rivals matchmaking manipulation since Season 0 (and researching mm manipulation in gaming since 2020). I've got evidence to bring forward about the extent of the manipulation that gamers *need* to be aware of, but ideally need my battlelog data from Netease to collate everything. 

The problem? Netease are refusing to send the data, were giving me an extreme run-around when trying to get information about my data, and now recently have removed the ability for any player to make a data request *AT ALL*.

&nbsp;


### What Happened? (The Evidence)

I decided to contact Netease Support to get my match data, so that I could collate everything and bring forward evidence from Season 0. I thought this would be a nice easy process, as it has been for the other requests I've made from developers in the past... How wrong I was.

&nbsp;

### First Netease Told Me I *Couldn't* Have My Data

![Alt Text](/assets/imgs/data_request_1.png "Add This Title")

The reason? "data related to Marvel Rivals cannot be disclosed or shared". Not only is that not a reason, but just to be clear, refusing a user access to their data *(in the UK & EU)* is **illegal**.

&nbsp;


### So I Dropped "UK GDPR" Thinking This Would Make Netease Comply

![Alt Text](/assets/imgs/data_request_2.png "Add This Title")

It stands for 'General Data Protection Regulation'... And compy? Nope! they didn't even reply

&nbsp;


### Next I Asked For The Contact Info For Their UK or EU Offices

![Local Image](/assets/imgs/data_request_3.png)

With another threat to contact the Information Commisioners Office (ICO), and a reminder that its my right to have access to my data... Great, now I feel like a fucking Karen.

&nbsp;


### Oh *Now* They're Miraculously Able To Process The Request

![Local Image](/assets/imgs/data_request_4.png)

They noted that they needed to verify my identity *(standard procedure for a data request)*, and that I could do this by making the request in game via the Customer Support Portal, and providing a session ID. 

![Approved?](/assets/imgs/knucles-approved.gif "It Was All Lies!")

But as we'll soon find out, this was just to give me the run-around. This shit wasn't approved at all, they just wanted to waste time as they still refused to send the data.

&nbsp;


### So I Jump On The Portal To Finalise The Request

![Local Image](/assets/imgs/data_request_portal_1.png)

Remember they told me to go on this portal, and submit the session ID to verify my identity. Should just be standard procedure, right?... Wrong!

*(please excuse the quality drop, I had to take photos of my TV as xbox screen capture doesn't grab the customer support chat since it opens in a seperate window)*

&nbsp;


### Netease Hurt Itself In Confusion? 

![Local Image](/assets/imgs/data_request_portal_2.png)

Don't forget this started with them outright refusing the request, then telling me to do it via the portal. Now I'm on the portal and they want me to *"specify what data you need so that we can verify it?"*... Verify it!?! What the hell is there to verify! I JUST WANT MY GAME DATA.

![Alt Text](/assets/imgs/playing_stupid.gif "Add This Title")

&nbsp;


### This Is When I Realised... I'm Getting Played

![Local Image](/assets/imgs/data_request_portal_3.png)

Just before this I'd replied with a question asking how long it would take to get my data back, and they reply with *this*!

Now they want "screenshots of the data issue", WTF?! Remember they asked me to submit the data request here, and tnow hey are acting like they have never heard of this mythical being that is a data request, and are asking me to send screenshots of the data issue. 

At this point I realised they weren't actually confused about what I was asking. They were giving me the run-around, just like when they initially refused the data request. They just don't want to fork over the data.

I cannot overstate to you how easy this is to do with literally *any* other company. 

&nbsp;


### Ok Let's Cut The Bullshit

![Local Image](/assets/imgs/data_request_portal_4.png)

At this point I'd given up on playing their stupid games, I make it clear that I'm requesting *"all of my data"*, and signed off with a reminder that they have 30 days to comply with the request by law. They stopped replying at this point, though I'd be lying if I said I expected I'd be getting my data in 30 days time.

![I Can't](/assets/imgs/mc-jugger-nuggets-scream.gif "I Can't")

That's literally me dealing with these clowns.

&nbsp;


### So?... The Data? What's Going On?

![Local Image](/assets/imgs/data_request_ico_1.png)

Well this is about 5 months ago. I did check after 30 days and of course I didn't get the data, but it's taken me some time to pick this back up as I've been busy with other things. Now after 5 months I've obviously *still* not recieved the data, but since 30 days has passed I'm able to raise this to the ICO (Information Commisioners Office) in the UK for them to chase after Netease for the data. 

What kind of sucks is that the waiting time for complaints is pretty insane right now, at around 5+ months *(21 weeks to be exact)*. That means though this was legally supposed to take 30 days, by the time I actually get the data it's likely to have taken well over 10 months.

&nbsp;


### NetEase Portal Now Blocks "Data Request"

![Social Credit +1000](/assets/imgs/social-credit.gif "Bing Chilling")

So this whole thing is from 5 months ago as I said. But I did hop on recently to try and contact NetEase customer support via the portal, and to see if they had made improvements which made it easier to make data requests... This was *seriously* wishful thinking on my behalf, because of course instead of getting better, it actually got *worse*.

Now you can't even make a data request AT ALL. The seemingly AI operated chatbot doesn't have a clue what a "data request" is, and just keeps going round in circular logic, making it literally impossible to not only make a data request, but for me to even query them about the data request they *said* they were processing 5 months ago... To be fair, did you *really* expect anything else?

I'd be remiss if I did compare this to the Chinese internet itself. Much like how terms like "Tiananmen Square Protests" and "Winnie The Pooh" are directly blocked in China, it seems like "Data Request" is blocked by NetEase. 

NetEase be like "data request?..."

&nbsp;


### What Does The Law Say?

Unfortunately for U.S gamers, this is one of those "EU Laws For The Win" situations, as EU (& UK) data laws are extremely robust and go a long way to protect our rights to access, update, restrict, and erase our data. This is covered by something called GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).

![Local Image](/assets/imgs/uk_gdpr_1.png)

Now this *does* get a bit fuzzy, because (incase you didn't know) Netease is a Chinese company, and I can confidently say the CCP *really* doesn't want to abide by these laws.

And I'd assume that if Netease Games were only based in China I'd be completely and utterly screwed here, they wouldn't have to abide by UK law, and there's no way I could have the law enforced on my behalf.

But unluckily for Netease they should *have* to because they have a Netease Games office based in the UK.

![Gotcha](/assets/imgs/gotcha-bish.gif "Gotcha")

I can't lie I'm not 100% sure on this one, but I am hopeful, as in similar situations like the case of TikTok, despite ByteDance being a primarily China based company, ByteDance has to comply with EU and UK law and allow users to request and recieve their data... Shit TikTok even has their own dedicated section in the app for it. For god's sake you know something's seriously wrong when it's a million times easier to get data from TikTok than it is from Netease!

&nbsp;


### What Happens ~~When~~ If The Data Turns Up?

Well first thing will be to see what's *actually* included. There isn't really a consensus in the industry (though there really should be) because these companies are rarely (if ever) challenged on these things, for example Activision provides hidden MMR data (as they should), whereas other companies don't provide this, but do give more extensive data on the individual actions taken in game (more than just kills, deaths, etc), so we'll really have to see.

But once I *do* (fingers crossed) get the data I'll be dropping some huge evidence on Marvel Rivals Season 0 matchmaking manipulation that will show players how the game's rigged ass algorithm works behind the scenes. And trust me on this one, it is actually fucking disgusting.

I would really love to put this out there now but I want to do this properly and make sure I have all the data verified on my end before I do, so unfortunately it is going to take some time, but it will be worth it because trust me on this one, Netease *(and many other "competitve multiplayer" developers)* are up to some truly fucked up shit when it comes to matchmaking manipulation.

### Takeaways

This should be a warning... (should be a red flag enough that they're refusing to send the data... (see top summary))

I know ActiBlizz aren't a "good company" but it is a stark contrast when dealing with a (western) company that's bound by law... And tbf they are the only company I have seen provide hidden MMR data in user data requests. Is there *seriously* any gamer out there that thinks that games companies should be allowed to hide this from us, as if it's *not* user data.

(OLD - Now compare this whole farce with Netease and Marvel Rivals to Activision and Call of Duty and see how stark the difference is. Quick and easy blah, I'm not trying to glaze ActiBlizz here, but they don't fuck around when it comes to data requests, and do give provide data points that other developers just straight up refuse to (like hidden MMR).)

This is currently a grey area and hasn't be legally contested (which is something I'm hoping to do in the near future)...

I know China is a modern day boogie man but this is a *real* problem, and something that gamers should be aware of, and worried about more and more in future, especially as Chinese companies like Tencent gobble up developers left right and center...

The whole MMR data from CoD, but have requested MMR data from other companies and they refuse to hand it over. This is a whole other can of worms and so it's a topic to save for another time but it *is* something we need to start discussing more - specifically the levels of obfuscation games companies are allowed to have, especially when it comes to "competitive" multiplayer games. This wouldn't have been a necessity XX years ago, but we're well deep into the era of Skill Based Matchmaking, Engagement Optimised Matchmaking, and now unfortunately Rigged & Heavily Manipulated Matchmaking to the point that it is a necessity (that...)
