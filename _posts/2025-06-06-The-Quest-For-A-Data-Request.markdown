TL;DR : Netease are illegally refusing to send me my gameplay data. When I get this data I'll be able to prove extreme levels of matchmaking manipulation from Marvel Rivals Season 0. The fact they're refusing to send the data should be a warning sign for gamers about the state the industry is taking. Trust me Netease is up to some seriously fucked up shit, and they're trying *really* hard to keep it covered up.

&nbsp;


### Intro

I've been doing research into Marvel Rivals matchmaking manipulation since Season 0 (and researching mm manipulation in gaming since 2020). I've got evidence to bring forward about the extent of the manipulation that gamers *need* to be aware of, but ideally need my battlelog data from Netease to collate everything. 

The problem? Netease are refusing to send the data, were giving me an extreme run-around when trying to get information about my data, and now recently have removed the ability for any player to make a data request *AT ALL*.

&nbsp;


### What Happened? (The Evidence)

I decided to contact Netease Support to get my match data, so that I could collate everything and bring forward evidence from Season 0. I thought this would be a nice easy process, as it has been for the other requests I've made from developers in the past... How wrong I was.

&nbsp;

### First Netease Told Me I *Couldn't* Have My Data

![Alt Text](/assets/imgs/data_request_1.png "Add This Title")

The reason? "data related to Marvel Rivals cannot be disclosed or shared". Not only is that not a reason, but just to be clear, refusing a user access to their data *(in the UK & EU)* is **illegal**.

&nbsp;


### So I Dropped "UK GDPR" Thinking This Would Make Netease Comply

![Alt Text](/assets/imgs/data_request_2.png "Add This Title")

It stands for 'General Data Protection Regulation'... And compy? Nope! they didn't even reply

&nbsp;


### Next I Asked For The Contact Info For Their UK or EU Offices

![Local Image](/assets/imgs/data_request_3.png)

With another threat to contact the Information Commisioners Office (ICO), and a reminder that its my right to have access to my data... Great, now I feel like a fucking Karen.

&nbsp;


### Oh *Now* They're Miraculously Able To Process The Request

![Local Image](/assets/imgs/data_request_4.png)

They noted that they needed to verify my identity *(standard procedure for a data request)*, and that I could do this by making the request in game via the Customer Support Portal, and providing a session ID. 

![Approved?](/assets/imgs/knuckles-approved.gif "It Was All Lies!")

But as we'll soon find out, this was just to give me the run-around. This shit wasn't approved at all, they just wanted to waste time as they still refused to send the data.

&nbsp;


### So I Jump On The Portal To Finalise The Request

![Local Image](/assets/imgs/data_request_portal_1.png)

Remember they told me to go on this portal, and submit the session ID to verify my identity. Should just be standard procedure, right?... Wrong!

*(please excuse the quality drop, I had to take photos of my TV as xbox screen capture doesn't grab the customer support chat since it opens in a seperate window)*

&nbsp;


### Netease Hurt Itself In Confusion? 

![Local Image](/assets/imgs/data_request_portal_2.png)

Don't forget this started with them outright refusing the request, then telling me to do it via the portal. Now I'm on the portal and they want me to *"specify what data you need so that we can verify it?"*... Verify it!?! What the hell is there to verify! I JUST WANT MY GAME DATA.

![Alt Text](/assets/imgs/playing_stupid.gif "Add This Title")

&nbsp;


### This Is When I Realised... I'm Getting Played

![Local Image](/assets/imgs/data_request_portal_3.png)

Just before this I'd replied with a question asking how long it would take to get my data back, and they reply with *this*!

Now they want "screenshots of the data issue", WTF?! Remember they asked me to submit the data request here, and tnow hey are acting like they have never heard of this mythical being that is a data request, and are asking me to send screenshots of the data issue. 

At this point I realised they weren't actually confused about what I was asking. They were giving me the run-around, just like when they initially refused the data request. They just don't want to fork over the data.

I cannot overstate to you how easy this is to do with literally *any* other company. 

&nbsp;


### Ok Let's Cut The Bullshit

![Local Image](/assets/imgs/data_request_portal_4.png)

At this point I'd given up on playing their stupid games, I make it clear that I'm requesting *"all of my data"*, and signed off with a reminder that they have 30 days to comply with the request by law. They stopped replying at this point, though I'd be lying if I said I expected I'd be getting my data in 30 days time.

![I Can't](/assets/imgs/mc-jugger-nuggets-scream.gif "I Can't")

That's literally me dealing with these clowns.

&nbsp;


### So?... The Data? What's Going On?

![Local Image](/assets/imgs/data_request_ico_1.png)

Well this is about 5 months ago. I did check after 30 days and of course I didn't get the data, but it's taken me some time to pick this back up as I've been busy with other things. Now after 5 months I've obviously *still* not recieved the data, but since 30 days has passed I'm able to raise this to the ICO (Information Commisioners Office) in the UK for them to chase after Netease for the data. 

What kind of sucks is that the waiting time for complaints is pretty insane right now, at around 5+ months *(21 weeks to be exact)*. That means though this was legally supposed to take 30 days, by the time I actually get the data it's likely to have taken well over 10 months.

&nbsp;


### NetEase Portal Now Blocks "Data Request"

So this whole thing is from 5 months ago as I said. But I did hop on recently to try and contact NetEase customer support via the portal, and to see if they had made improvements which made it easier to make data requests... This was *seriously* wishful thinking on my behalf, because of course instead of getting better, it actually got *worse*.

The AI operated chatbot doesn't have a clue what a "data request" is, and just keeps going round in circular logic.

I ask it for a "data request" and it has literally no idea what that is, the only options it provides aren't close...

![NetEase's New Customer Support Portal](/assets/imgs/data_request_portal_B_1.png)

And if you type "None of the above" it just loops back to the start...

![NetEase's New Customer Support Portal](/assets/imgs/data_request_portal_B_2.png)

I'd be remiss if I did compare this to the Chinese internet itself. Much like how terms like "Tiananmen Square Protests" and "Winnie The Pooh" are directly blocked in China, it seems like "Data Request" is blocked by NetEase.

&nbsp;


### What Does The Law Say?

Unfortunately for U.S gamers, this is one of those "EU Laws For The Win" situations, as EU (& UK) data laws are extremely robust and go a long way to protect our rights to access, update, restrict, and erase our data. This is covered by something called GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).

![Local Image](/assets/imgs/uk_gdpr_1.png)

Now this *does* get a bit fuzzy, because (incase you didn't know) Netease is a Chinese company, and I can confidently say the CCP *really* doesn't want to abide by these laws.

And I'd assume that if Netease Games were only based in China I'd be completely and utterly screwed here, they wouldn't have to abide by UK law, and there's no way I could have the law enforced on my behalf.

But unluckily for Netease they should *have* to because they have a Netease Games office based in the UK.

![Gotcha](/assets/imgs/gotcha-bish.gif "Gotcha")

I can't lie I'm not 100% sure on this one, but I am hopeful, as in similar situations like the case of TikTok, despite ByteDance being a primarily China based company, ByteDance has to comply with EU and UK law and allow users to request and recieve their data... Shit TikTok even has their own dedicated section in the app for it. For god's sake you know something's seriously wrong when it's a million times easier to get data from TikTok than it is from Netease!

&nbsp;


### What Happens ~~When~~ If The Data Turns Up?

Well first thing will be to see what's *actually* included. There isn't really a consensus in the industry (though there really should be) because these companies are rarely (if ever) challenged on these things, for example Activision provides hidden MMR data, whereas other companies don't provide this, but do give more extensive data on the individual actions taken in game (more than just kills, deaths, etc), so we'll really have to see.

But once I *do* (fingers crossed) get the data I'll be dropping some huge evidence on Marvel Rivals Season 0 matchmaking manipulation that will show players how the game's rigged ass algorithm works behind the scenes. And trust me on this one, it is actually fucking disgusting.

I would really love to put this out there now but I want to do this properly and make sure I have all the data verified on my end before I do, so unfortunately it is going to take some time, but it will be worth it because trust me on this one, Netease *(and many other "competitve multiplayer" developers)* are up to some truly fucked up shit when it comes to matchmaking manipulation.

&nbsp;


### Comparing This To Activision

I know ActiBlizz aren't a "good company" by any stretch of the imagination, but I think its important to point out the *stark* contrast between dealing with a western company that's bound by law, vs Netease.

Activision has a portal already set up for making data requests and is incredibly easy to use. You simply sign in with the respective accounts (e.g. Microsoft and Activision), make the request, and its sent to you within a month. 

![Local Image](/assets/imgs/activision-data-request-portal.png)

This is the way it *should* be.

Now not to glaze Activision, but as I noted prior they are the only company I have seen provide hidden MMR data in user data requests. Sure this is a tangent but I thought I'd bring it up because its one of the many grey areas that currently exists *(that being : what is and isn't required to be included in a data request)*. I mean is there *seriously* any gamer out there that thinks that games companies should be allowed to hide basic hidden MMR data from us?

This is a whole other can of worms and so it's a topic to save for another time but it *is* something we need to start discussing more - specifically the levels of obfuscation games companies are allowed to have, especially when it comes to "competitive" multiplayer games. This wouldn't have been a necessity 10 - 15 years ago, but we're deep into the era of SBMM (skill based matchmaking), EOMM (engagement optimised matchmaking), and now Rigged & Manipulated Matchmaking to the point that basic transparency is a necessity.

And just to be clear, every single game's company I have queried has at *minimum* has provided complete battlelog data on request... Every single one except NetEase of course.

&nbsp;


### Make No Mistake, This Is A Cover Up

NetEase is up to something seriously disgusting with the levels of matchmaking manipulation it has implemented in Marvel Rivals... And they aren't the only ones.

And even though I can prove it I need my data to serve as additional evidence. 

But NetEase is outright refusing to send me the data, and that should be a huge red flag to everyone about the extent of what is happening. NetEase has secrets they want to keep hidden, and they are willing to break the law to keep it that way.

![Red Flag](/assets/imgs/red-flag.gif "Me Everytime There's No API")

The game already has no API (another red flag imo), which is a very intentional obfuscation tactic to stop researchers like me from being able to prove matchmaking manipulation (but we'll save this for another day). However without access to the most basic user data like complete battlelogs future researchers have ZERO chance of providing evidence of abuse and holding companies accountable for decieving their players, and I find that extremely worrying.

Lastly, I know China is a modern day boogie man but this is a *real* problem, and something that gamers should be aware of, and worried about more and more in future, especially as more and more Chinese developers are entering into the competitive multiplayer space every year, and Chinese companies like Tencent gobble up developers left right and center.

And sure, if I was just trying to get my data for pointless reasons this wouldn't be such a big deal... But it is.

As I've said, what NetEase is up to is truly disgusting - essentially rigging the outcome of games - and if I ever actually get access to my data I can prove it.

Make no mistake, what NetEase is doing is a cover up.
