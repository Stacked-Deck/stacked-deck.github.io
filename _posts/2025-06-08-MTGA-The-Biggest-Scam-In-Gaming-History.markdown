TL;DR : Blah

&nbsp;

DONT MAKE THIS ONE PUBLIC YET JUST INCASE - NEW REPO IDEA BEST AND THEN MAKE IT PRIVATE FOR NOW

TBF JUST MAKE *THIS* PRIVATE AND THEN GET ON WITH IT!

&nbsp;

COLLATE IMAGES AND DATA

WRITE BASIC KINDA FLOW AND FORMAT

GET STUFF DOWN, MOSTLY AS THE FORMAT CAN BE USED TO MAKE CREATING VIDS ON THIS MUCH MUCH EASIER (and then serve as a resource for those who want to delve deeper into specifics, and verify details)

&nbsp;

Consider new repo for this with different site name??? 
just cause its nice to keep each game seperate, but idk
but also because i wanna use up some of those different names XD
